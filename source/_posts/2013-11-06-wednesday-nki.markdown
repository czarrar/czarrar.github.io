# ABIDE

We brought over the two drives with preprocessed ABIDE data from Pierre and Xinian to NKI. We attempted to mount the drives to rocky but got a "Not Authorized" error. I sent an email to Stan with Cameron cc'ed to see if we could deal with this issue (thinks we need sudo privileges).

Cameron will be getting sudo access and will figure out mounting the drive.


# NiLearn

The subjects for nilearn (ADHD40) appear to be done. I modified my prior compile scripts to take from the new preprocessed output (without nuisance correction and bandpass filtering). I re-uploaded the files to connectir (waiting to finish).


# Emotional-BS

Read some articles. Check the QC.


# Quick-Pack

Look into the GUI error...
