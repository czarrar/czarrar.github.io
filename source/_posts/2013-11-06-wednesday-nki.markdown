# ABIDE

We brought over the two drives with preprocessed ABIDE data from Pierre and Xinian to NKI. We attempted to mount the drives to rocky but got a "Not Authorized" error. I sent an email to Stan with Cameron cc'ed to see if we could deal with this issue (thinks we need sudo privileges).

Cameron will be getting sudo access and will figure out mounting the drive.


# NiLearn

The subjects for nilearn (ADHD40) appear to be done. I modified my prior compile scripts to take from the new preprocessed output (without nuisance correction and bandpass filtering). I re-uploaded the files to connectir and sent an email to Gael et al. So should be all done here.

I believe I do want to get access to ADHD200 nitrc sftp so I can upload the data to that site. Right now it is on my own connectir nitrc site.
