  <div class="entry-content"><h1>NiLearn Test Data</h1>

<p>Note that the code to generate all this is as well as the actual package is in <code>/home/data/Projects/CPAC_Regression_Test/2013-10-04_v0-3-2/run/gael-o/package</code>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already gotten the subject data and regressors. I am left to create the group phenotypic file. It appears that I don&rsquo;t need to duplicate the previous setup so I can use what we have on motion per subject. With this new data packaged up, I uploaded it to my connectir repository as I still don&rsquo;t have access to the ADHD200 repository.</p>

<p>The download links are below:</p>

<p><a href="http://connectir.projects.nitrc.org/adhd40_p1.nii.gz">http://connectir.projects.nitrc.org/adhd40_p1.nii.gz</a>

<a href="http://connectir.projects.nitrc.org/adhd40_p4.nii.gz">http://connectir.projects.nitrc.org/adhd40_p4.nii.gz</a></p>

<p>And I have contacted the other peeps about this. So DONE.</p>

<hr />

<h1>ABIDE Preprocessing</h1>

<p>I found out that the QC pages are a little broken. So this will have to wait.</p>

<h2>Run Config Setup</h2>

<p>I have adjusted this file to run one subject for every two nodes. I am using FSL5 now. Preprocessing will be run as well as all the derivatives except centrality (degree or eigen). This is because they both need a decent amount of RAM and computational time so I&rsquo;ll wait to run them separately later.</p>

<hr />

<h1>QuickPack</h1>

<p>So the first general issue that I&rsquo;m experiencing is that if I run everything (no quick-pack), then I don&rsquo;t get any of the sym links. However, in my Emotional-BS run, the symlinks all seem to be fine! A little weird. I&rsquo;m not sure what is causing the problem.</p>

<h2>Running with just CPAC</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m focusing on why I&rsquo;m getting symlink issues when I run internally with CPAC. I think the reasons that no files are being symlinked is because there might be single quotes in the strategy part of the path.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ln -s /home2/data/Projects/ABIDE_Initiative/CPAC/test_qp/All_Output/pipeline_RameyBorough/0051466_session_1/qc/mni_normalized_anatomical_a/mni_anat_a.png /home2/data/Projects/ABIDE_Initiative/CPAC/test_qp/All_Output/sym_links/pipeline_RameyBorough/_compcor_<span class="s1">&#39;ncomponents_5_linear1.global1.motion1.quadratic1.compcor1.csf0&#39;</span>_CSF_0.96_GM_0.7_WM_0.96/0051466_session_1/scan/qc/mni_anat_a.png
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If I run this command that was spit out from CPAC, then I get a &ldquo;No such file or directory&rdquo; error. This error doesn&rsquo;t appear with CPAC but this might explain why no symlinks were generated.</p>

<p>Now we must understand why those single quotes are there. We should note that there were actually 2 strategies that I had given but only one strategy folder in the symlinks directory folder was created. I wonder if this has to do with some error?</p>

<p>I tried to open the config file with the GUI and re-save it, seeing if that would help but it didn&rsquo;t. Now I&rsquo;ll try to run the pipeline from the GUI. Yup that fixed the issue and it isn&rsquo;t related to the fact that I&rsquo;m using Dan&rsquo;s path and shiz. Running this one subject through the GUI.</p>

<h2>Running ALFF</h2>

<p>There was one previous and confusing link issue. However, another issue that I didn&rsquo;t notice was the ALFF output directory using single quotes in its symlinks strategy directory and only has one of the two strategies. This suggests a potential benefit in running this through the GUI.</p>

<h3>GUI</h3>

<p>This run failed. The error message is below. I am not sure what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<h3>CLI</h3>

<p>The error on the command-line is driven in part by two correction strategies (with and without global). Since my quick pack, can&rsquo;t really do both of those strategies at once anyway, why not just have one strategy specified. Trying this with ALFF and that didn&rsquo;t work! Ugh so it&rsquo;s specifically related to the command-line, which is doing something differently than the GUI.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Emotional-BS</h1>

<p>The preprocessing is done but the QC pages were not generated due to some issue in CPAC. I wish there was some way of running the QC scripts with the current outputs without me having to re-run all of CPAC. Since I ran via gelert using the <code>/tmp</code> directory, it will also need to redo all the processing.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Random</h1>

<p>I spent a bit of time getting the table of contents to work on these pages. Hopefully it was worth it (I might want to also add a go back to the top link for each header). At the very least it gives a sort-of summary list of what will be on the post.</p>

<p>I think I also had a bit of trouble keeping on track today. It was very frustrating and I&rsquo;m hoping it was just re-adjusting to coming back to work after a brief break.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m trying to address some reviewer questions regarding the computational complexity of CWAS and particularly the MDMR step.</p>

<p>In summary, the complexity (I think) is</p>

<ul>
<li>O(V*n<sup>2</sup>) for computing the distance matrices</li>
<li>O(k*n<sup>2</sup>) for creating the hat matrices</li>
<li>O(n<sup>3</sup>) for gower centering the distance matrices</li>
<li>O(Pxn<sup>2xV</sup>) for MDMR</li>
</ul>


<p>where V = # of voxels, n = # of subjects, k = # of regressors, P = # of permutations.</p>

<p>The real optimization is the final MDMR step, where the traditional MDMR approach is O(Pxn<sup>3xV</sup>) or O(n<sup>3</sup>) whereas ours is O(n<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<h1>About Time Complexity</h1>

<p>My first step here is to build up some knowledge about the computational time needed for computing the different steps. I searched the terms computational complexity and time complexity but could have also looked at Big-O Notation. It seems like time complexity is the most appropriate term.</p>

<p>Efficiency of an algorithm can be measured by [1]:</p>

<ul>
<li>Execution time (time complexity)</li>
<li>Amount of memory required (space complexity)</li>
</ul>


<p>Time complexity expresses the relationship between the size of the size of the input and the run time for the algorithm. There&rsquo;s other relevant information on the wiki page and some online slides [2,3].</p>

<h2>Complexity of Math Operations</h2>

<p>For measuring the complexity of individual operations, wikipedia has a great summary page [4]. Although it gives difference values for the elementary addition and multiplications, it seems one might assume they run in linear or quasi-linear time (based on other pages?). However, technically multiplication is n<sup>2</sup> or n*log(n) (depending on the implementation). Matrix multiplication is n<sup>3</sup>. This is a little weird because I think of the correlation coefficient as n<sup>2</sup> since that is the number of pairwise correlations you are computing and according to a cs stackexchange post, pearson correlation is O(n) [5].</p>

<h1>CWAS Complexity</h1>

<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s all the background I need. Now let&rsquo;s figure out the complexity of CWAS. Since the computation of the connectivity maps is shared amongst many algorithms, I will ignore that step and start from the computation of the distance matrices.</p>

<h2>Distance Matrices</h2>

<p>This step is done independently at each voxel. And, at a voxel, we have connectivity with m voxels across n participants. On this <code>mxn</code> matrix, we compute the pearson correlation between the m connectivity maps for all possible pairs of participants. Assuming that each correlation is computed in O(n) time [5], changing the number of voxels will lead to an O(n) change while changing the number of subjects will lead to an O(n<sup>2</sup>) change. Thus, this step should be O(V*n<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<h2>MDMR</h2>

<h3>Hat Matrix</h3>

<p>This step involves <code>H = X ( X^T X )^-1 X^T</code>. Note that <code>X</code> is n participants x k regressors. So from the formula, we can see that there are</p>

<ul>
<li>3 matrix algebra operations</li>
<li>1 matrix inversion</li>
<li>2 transpositions (but I won&rsquo;t count those)</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these operations is O(k<em>n<sup>2</sup>) [4] so this step has O(k</em>n<sup>2</sup>) complexity. This I believe would be around the complexity of multiple linear regression for one voxel as well [6].</p>

<h3>Gower Matrix</h3>

<p>This step involves <code>G = (I - 11^T/n) * A * (I - 11^T/n)</code>. Note that <code>I</code> is the identity matrix (n x n), <code>1</code> is a vector of n 1&rsquo;s, and <code>A</code> is half the squared distance matrix. So from the formula, we can see</p>

<ul>
<li>2 subtractions (additions)</li>
<li>2 divisions (multiplications)</li>
<li>2 matrix multiplications</li>
</ul>


<p>Since the matrix operation will dominate the time, the complexity is O(V*n<sup>3</sup>) where V is the number of voxels.</p>

<h3>Pseudo-F Statistic</h3>

<p>This step involves <code>(HG/(k-1))/((I-H)G/(n-m))</code>. The division parts are not really relevant for the complexity and indeed are not needed when computing the permutations (McArdle and Anderson, 2001), so we actually have <code>(HG)/((I-H)G)</code>. Here H is a vector of hat matrix vectors so it&rsquo;s a P x n<sup>2</sup> matrix (P = # of permutations) and G is a vector of gower matrices so it&rsquo;s a n<sup>2</sup> x V matrix (V = # of voxels). This means that there are:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 subtraction (I-H)</li>
<li>2 matrix multiplications</li>
<li>1 division</li>
</ul>


<p>Since the matrix multiplication takes the dominant time, we can ignore the other two division operations. The computational complexity is then O(Pxn<sup>2xV</sup>) so as in the distance matrix step the complexity will scale by n<sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I&rsquo;ve got through a few things. First, I finished compiling the <code>regressors.csv</code> file for</p>

<p>Some minor things, I helped Krishna with some ROI error he had in CPAC. It turned out that his issue was due to incorrectly binarizing the mask.</p>

<h1>QuickPack</h1>

<p>Trying my hand again on quick pack today. Last time I got a bunch of different errors that I really couldn&rsquo;t track. I am re-running the complete run to see what errors I get again and try to figure those out. I&rsquo;m also rerunning the alff to see what happens there.</p>

<h2>Complete Run</h2>

<p>This appears to be re-running smoothly (knock on wood). The last time I ran a complete (preprocessing + derivatives) run, it led to some unclear problems.</p>

<h2>ALFF QP</h2>

<p>I get the same link error as I did before. The error occurs on line 562 in <code>utils.py</code> within the <code>create_symbolic_links</code>. The line and error are</p>

<pre><code>ext = fname.split('.', 1)[1]
IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>

<p>Basically <code>fname</code> should be a filename but a directory is passed instead and so it fails. Specifically, it appears to be passing <code>/home2/data/Projects/ABIDE_Initiative/CPAC/test_qp/ALFF_Output/pipeline_0/0051466_session_1/functional_freq_filtered/_scan_rest_1_rest/sinker_16</code>. I don&rsquo;t have much sense about what is going on with this file.</p>

<p>Other bits of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The crash file is located <code>/home2/data/Projects/ABIDE_Initiative/CPAC/test_qp/crash/crash-20131030-145001-milham-link_16.a0.np
z</code>.</li>
<li>The directory in the working directory is <code>/data/Projects/ABIDE_Initiative/CPAC/test_qp/ALFF_Working/resting_preproc_0051466_session_1/_scan_rest_1_rest/link_16</code></li>
</ul>


<h3>Steve Talk</h3>

<p>I discussed this issue with Steve and it seems I will need to get down and dirty with nipype to understand the origin of this problem.</p>

<h2>REHO QP</h2>

<p>Here I got two errors. One of the errors was the same as with ALFF except instead of link_16 it is link_5. The other error is new and specific to REHO with the crash file: <code>/home2/data/Projects/ABIDE_Initiative/CPAC/test_qp/crash/crash-20131030-164123-milham-reho_map.a0.a0.npz</code>. It appears the error is an empty input filename being passed to the <code>compute_reho</code> in <code>reho/utils</code>.</p>

<p>A snapshot of the error is given below:</p>

<pre><code>/data/Projects/ABIDE_Initiative/CPAC/test_qp/Reho_Working/resting_preproc_0051466_session_1/reho_0/_scan_rest_1_rest/_scan_rest_1_rest/reho_map/&lt;string&gt; in compute_reho(in_file, mask_file, cluster_size)

<h1>Preprocessing EmotionalBS</h1>

<p>I am going to preprocess the emotionalBS data again with CPAC+ANTS. Some relevant parameters are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Used ANTS for registration</li>
<li>Two nuisance correction strategies

<pre><code>  * compcor+motion+linear+quadratic
  * compcor+global+motion+linear+quadratic
</code></pre></li>
<li>Both frequency filtering (0.01-0.1 Hz) and no filtering</li>
<li>Smoothing of 4.5mm (only for derivatives)</li>
<li>Generated some SCA and drSCA based derivates using ROIs/maps from the ABIDE preprocessing. Otherwise no other derivatives were created.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Install FSL 5 for Gelert</h2>

<p>I was a little confused on how to install fsl 5 to a custom path (<code>/home2/data/PublicProgram</code>). It seemed to go through neurodebian and apt-get, I needed certain admin privileges that even Mike&rsquo;s account didn&rsquo;t have. And even if I had those, it wasn&rsquo;t clear how I would install to a custom directory. Then I realized I could just copy the current fsl5 in <code>/usr/share/fsl/5.o</code> into that directory. The reason for this (<code>/home2/data/PublicProgram</code>) directory is so</p>

<h1>New Journal</h1>

<p>I also worked on setting up this blog/journal with github user account. The goal is to chronicle my work efforts with particular thought on any issues I encounter. A major side benefit will be easier communication with others in the lab (e.g., was able to easily show the error for ALFF quick pack to Steve). Previously, I had been using different journal pages for each of my projects. I ended up being a big confused where to post stuff and often lost track of the markdown pages that I had created before they were published. With one journal site, this should all be easier.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also testing out this slightly different jekyll wrapper (octopress). I unfortunately spent a lot longer (2 hours) setting it up cuz of a git error then I had wanted. So I hope some of its benefits over jekyll bootstrap such as easier syncing, simpler interface, and simpler integration of more advanced plugins, will be useful in the long run. That way I can justify my time spent installing it!</p>
